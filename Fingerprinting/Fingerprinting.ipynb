    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigates the efficiency of randomized algorithms for verifying matrix multiplication. We implement the standard $O(n^3)$ deterministic matrix multiplication algorithm as a baseline and compare it against the $O(n^2)$ randomized Freivald's Test. Our from-scratch implementations are benchmarked for wall-clock time, and Freivald's test is further analyzed for its probabilistic error-detection guarantee. The empirical results confirm that Freivald's test offers a significant performance advantage, validating its $O(n^2)$ complexity, and successfully demonstrates the $\\ge 50\\%$ probability of detecting an incorrect multiplication."

    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the problem of verifying a matrix product: given three $n \\times n$ matrices $A$, $B$, and $C$, how can we efficiently check if $A \\times B = C$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline: Standard Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** The standard algorithm computes the product $C' = A \\times B$ deterministically. It then compares every element of $C'$ to the corresponding element in $C$. If all elements match, the equality is verified.\n",
    "* **Asymptotic Analysis:**\n",
    "    * **Time: $O(n^3)$** — To compute each of the $n^2$ elements in the resulting matrix $C'$, a dot product of one row from $A$ and one column from $B$ is required. This dot product takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the total time is $O(n^2 \\times n) = O(n^3)$.\n",
    "    * **Space: $O(n^2)$** — To store the resulting $C'$ matrix for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Algorithm: Freivald’s Test\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Description:** Freivald's Test is a randomized (Monte Carlo) algorithm that verifies the equality in $O(n^2)$ time. Instead of computing the full $A \\times B$ product, it checks the equality $A \\times B - C = 0$ by using a random \"fingerprint.\" \n",
    "    1.  Generate a random $n \\times 1$ vector $r$ where each entry is either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    2.  Compute the expression $(A \\times B - C) \\times r$, which can be rewritten as $(A \\times (B \\times r)) - (C \\times r)$.\n",
    "    3.  This is efficient because matrix-vector multiplication is only $O(n^2)$. We compute $P_1 = B \\times r$, then $P_2 = A \\times P_1$, and $P_3 = C \\times r$.\n",
    "    4.  If $P_2 - P_3 = 0$ (a zero vector), the algorithm returns `True` (likely equal). Otherwise, it returns `False` (definitely not equal).\n",
    "* **Probabilistic Guarantee:**\n",
    "    * If $A \\times B = C$, the test *always* returns `True` (zero chance of error).\n",
    "    * If $A \\times B \\neq C$, the test returns `False` with a probability of at least $1/2$.\n",
    "* **Asymptotic Analysis:**\n",
    "    * **Time: $O(n^2)$** — The algorithm is dominated by three matrix-vector multiplications ($B \\times r$, $A \\times (Br)$, and $C \\times r$), each of which takes $O(n^2)$ time. The total time is $O(n^2 + n^2 + n^2) = O(n^2)$.\n",

    "**Result:** With $k=10$, our 100 trials resulted in **0 false positives**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** This demonstrates that the algorithm can be made practically infallible. While a single test has a 50% chance of failure, running it just 10 times reduces the chance of a false positive to less than 0.1%. For any practical application, this provides a level of certainty that is as good as a deterministic check, while still retaining the $O(k \\cdot n^2)$ runtime, which is vastly superior to $O(n^3)$."

    "\n",
    "This project successfully implemented and analyzed Freivald's Test, a randomized algorithm for matrix multiplication verification. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Findings:**\n",
    "1.  **Performance:** Our empirical benchmarks confirmed the theoretical complexities. Freivald's $O(n^2)$ runtime is drastically faster than the $O(n^3)$ deterministic algorithm, making it the only viable option for large matrices.\n",
    "2.  **Probability:** Our analysis of 1,000 trials on a known-bad matrix supported the $\\ge 50\\%$ error-detection guarantee.\n",
    "3.  **Reliability (Bonus):** We demonstrated that by running the test $k=10$ times, the probability of a false positive is reduced to near-zero, providing deterministic-level confidence with randomized-level speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** Our implementation in pure Python, while adhering to the \"from-scratch\" mandate, is much slower than an optimized C or NumPy equivalent. However, the *relative* performance difference between the $O(n^3)$ and $O(n^2)$ algorithms is independent of the language and clearly validates the algorithm's design."
